(First) real project: BuddyStream.
----------

Motivation:
My girlfriend likes to watch me play story games. And sometimes the streaming quality is just not good enough. So I've decided to take matters into my own hands.

----------

Goals:
The first two things to attain are low latency and at least 1080p on 60 fps. 50 fps are probably also gonna be fine.

Of course we can't forget about the security. Well we are going to use zerotier-one while developing. I would really like to develop an inapp soulution in the future.
